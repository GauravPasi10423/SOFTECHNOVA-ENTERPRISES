 Java Swing Calculator â€“ Project Description
Overview:

This project is a simple GUI-based calculator developed using Java Swing. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with additional functions like square, square root, reciprocal, and decimal handling. The user interface is interactive and visually styled to enhance usability.

ðŸ”§ Features:
Basic Arithmetic Operations

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (Ã—)

Division (/)

Advanced Functions

Square (xÂ²)

Square Root (âˆšx)

Reciprocal (1/x)

Decimal Point Support (.)

Input & Output

Single-line display for results and input

Supports chaining operations

Deletes last digit using DEL

Clears the screen using C

ON/OFF Toggle

Controls calculator power state

Disables/enables all buttons and input fields accordingly

Design & Usability

Clear and organized layout using JButton, JTextField, and JLabel

Font and color styling for better visibility

Error handling for divide-by-zero operations

Responsive button placement and layout

ðŸ’» Technologies Used:
Language: Java

GUI Toolkit: Java Swing (JFrame, JButton, JTextField, etc.)

Formatting: DecimalFormat for proper display of results

ðŸ“‚ How It Works:
Each number and operator button appends to a JTextField.

When an operator is clicked, it stores the first operand and waits for the second.

On pressing =, it performs the selected operation and displays the result.

All operations are processed using double precision.

Additional operations (like square, square root) process the current input instantly.

The calculator can be turned ON/OFF using radio buttons, which enable or disable the full interface accordingly.

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements (Optional Enhancements):
Keyboard input support

Scientific calculator mode

Expression-based evaluation (e.g., 3 + 4 * 5)

Improved UI using Layout Managers or JavaFX
