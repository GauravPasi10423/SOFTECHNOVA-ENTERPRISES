Java Swing Calculator ‚Äì Project Description
Overview:

This project is a simple GUI-based calculator developed using Java Swing. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with additional functions like square, square root, reciprocal, and decimal handling. The user interface is interactive and visually styled to enhance usability.

üîß Features:
Basic Arithmetic Operations

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (√ó)

Division (/)

Advanced Functions

Square (x¬≤)

Square Root (‚àöx)

Reciprocal (1/x)

Decimal Point Support (.)

Input & Output

Single-line display for results and input

Supports chaining operations

Deletes last digit using DEL

Clears the screen using C

ON/OFF Toggle

Controls calculator power state

Disables/enables all buttons and input fields accordingly

Design & Usability

Clear and organized layout using JButton, JTextField, and JLabel

Font and color styling for better visibility

Error handling for divide-by-zero operations

Responsive button placement and layout

üíª Technologies Used:
Language: Java

GUI Toolkit: Java Swing (JFrame, JButton, JTextField, etc.)

Formatting: DecimalFormat for proper display of results

üìÇ How It Works:
Each number and operator button appends to a JTextField.

When an operator is clicked, it stores the first operand and waits for the second.

On pressing =, it performs the selected operation and displays the result.

All operations are processed using double precision.

Additional operations (like square, square root) process the current input instantly.

The calculator can be turned ON/OFF using radio buttons, which enable or disable the full interface accordingly.

üìå Future Improvements (Optional Enhancements):
Keyboard input support

Scientific calculator mode

Expression-based evaluation (e.g., 3 + 4 * 5)

Improved UI using Layout Managers or JavaFX

Java Swing Currency Converter ‚Äì Project Description
Overview:

I developed a Currency Converter application using Java Swing as part of my internship project at Softechnova Enterprises. This desktop-based application allows users to easily convert amounts between multiple currencies (USD, EUR, INR, GBP) using predefined exchange rates.

The application features a simple and interactive GUI, where users can select the source and target currencies through dropdown menus, enter the amount, and instantly view the converted result. It includes proper error handling to manage invalid inputs, ensuring a smooth user experience.

üîß Key Features:
Supports multiple currencies (USD, EUR, INR, GBP)

Simple and clean user interface using Java Swing components (JFrame, JComboBox, JTextField, JButton, JLabel)

Real-time conversion calculations

Uses HashMap to manage exchange rates efficiently

Input validation and error message pop-ups for invalid inputs

Window centered automatically for better usability

üíª Technologies Used:
Language: Java

GUI Toolkit: Swing

Data Structure: HashMap

üöÄ Future Scope:
Integration of live currency exchange APIs

Addition of more currencies

Enhanced design using advanced layout managers or JavaFX

Keyboard input and shortcut key support

Java Swing Number Guessing Game ‚Äì Project Description
Overview:

This is a GUI-based Number Guessing Game developed using Java Swing. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user attempts to guess the number, receiving real-time feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game includes options to reset the game or exit the application.

üîß Features
Random Number Generation:
Generates a random number between 1 and 100 on every new game.

Real-Time Feedback:
Provides hints if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Input Validation:
Ensures that user input is numeric and within the valid range (1-100).

Reset Functionality:
Allows users to start a new game with a new random number.

Exit Button:
Cleanly exits the game when the user chooses to quit.

User Interface:

Designed with JFrame, JLabel, JTextField, and JButton components.

Dark-themed background with highlighted instruction and result texts.

Buttons styled with colors for better visibility.

üíª Technologies Used
Language: Java

GUI Toolkit: Java Swing (JFrame, JButton, JLabel, JTextField)

Utility: Random class for number generation

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
At launch, the program generates a random number between 1 and 100.

The user inputs a guess into the text field.

On clicking Guess, the program compares the user input with the random number.

The result label provides feedback:

Too low

Too high

Correct guess

The Reset button generates a new random number and clears previous input.

The Exit button terminates the application.

üöÄ Future Improvements (Optional):
Add scoring system based on number of attempts.

Limit maximum number of attempts.

Display history of guesses.

Sound effects or animations on correct guesses.

Improved GUI design using layout managers or JavaFX.
